    <p>Thank you for contacting us in regards to purchasing an Extended Service
    Contract for your Harley-Davidson motorcycle! I’ve outlined your options here
    in this email, as well as linked the informational website which includes
    further details.</p>

    <p class="bold">After deciding on the terms below, use the following link
    to submit your choices and provide information regarding your current
    extended service plan. The link will be active for 24 hours,
    after which you will need to resubmit the enrollment form if you have not
    yet decided on terms.</p>

    <p class="bold">24hr Token: <%= tokenURL %></p>

    <p>As long as your motorcycle is still covered under a current Extended Service
    Plan, <b>you can renew coverage for an additional 4 years.</b></p>

    <p>Early in 2014, Harley-Davidson no longer allowed dealers to sell the CNA
    administered ESP outside of the dealerships. This mandate turned out to be a
    blessing in disguise. We were able to transition to a different extended
    service plan which allows for online sales and provides an excellent benefit
    package.</p>

    <p>CornerStone has been in the Extended Service Program business since 1973.
    They also are the administrator for Suzuki’s and Artic Cat’s Extended Service
    Plans. Their customer service is top notch and coverage is even better!
    Behind the scenes at every dealership, the same process happens for a claim.
    The service writer has to call the underwriter and they pay with a credit card
    over the phone. The great part about this plan vs. Harley-Davidson’s ESP is that
    there is no deductible and the coverage is the same as the factory warranty.</p>

    <p>I’ve launched a new website to provide extra information, pricing,
    claims process and FAQ.</p>
